Changelog 2.2.0 - 6 March 2021

- [RedGriffin] Voices are now assigned at random from the whole pool of voices available in the property tree.
               This will give the sensation of speaking to different operators, especially when used with
               festival server and providing a fairly good number of different voices with custom properties
               in /sim/sound/voices/voice[x].
               Pilot voice is always assigned to the voice having in the description the tag "pilot". This voice
               is exclusively assigned to the pilot and excluded from the pool of random voices.
- [RedGriffin] Added support for festival server. In case /sim/sound/voices/voice[x]/festival is true and
               festival is initialized with audio async mode (audio_mode 'async) in
               sound/sim/sound/voices/voice[x]/preamble, Red Griffin ATC will split text in multiple parts and
               send them all in sequence to festival in order to provide a quicker response (actually, creating
               utterances while speaking), otherwise text is sent to the speech synthetizer (internal flite-hts
               or festival) in just one string.
- [RedGriffin} Improved algorithm in getApproachingRunway() to determine the right runway in case of
               parallel runways
- [RedGriffin] Changed most of getprop and setprop to Nasal global.props functions

Changelog 1.2.2 - 22 April 2020

- [RedGriffin] Fixed missing getprop() in updateATC() due to unknown editing
               procedure which unintentionally removed it, who knows why, maybe it
               was kate editor's pedantic highlighting when searching?
               I like kate editor (a very nice programmer editor also having Nasal
               syntax support) but sometimes it is quite annoying when it keeps
               the text highlighted and you can easily overwrite/replace it. I
               guess this was the case because it happens quite often.
